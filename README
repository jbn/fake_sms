This is a very na√Øve implementation of a dumb notifiaction service. It uses 
Google App Engine's simple webapp framework. I wrote it as a learning 
experiment before writing some more serious App Engine projects. It can
be found running online at:

   http://fakesms.pathdependent.com/

It mostly exists to notify me -- or anyone else who wishes to use it --
when a long-running job has finished. If the computer running the job
doesn't have sendmail, (or even if it does,) then this is a very easy way
of adding email notifications on completion. Just execute a HTTP-GET for the
final command in the long running job.

This is meant to be very simple. The entire message should fit in the
subject; the body of the message just says who sent it (fakesms).
